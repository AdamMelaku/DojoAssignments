          <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x  </li>
            <li><a href="#">Variable Assignments</a> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = Assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10</li>
            <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding',2,"Dojo"]; and Object - {first_name,'Jane',last_name,'Doe'}</li>
            <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different actions for decisions - hitting different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. YOu can use conditional statments in your code to accomplis this. There are the followoing conditional statements: if a specified conidtion is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condiiton to test, if the first conditon is false, else we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop.</li>
            <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over again.</li>
